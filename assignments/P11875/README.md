## Description: In this program, we need to determine who the captain of the team will be based on their age. The basic idea is to make sure the captain's age is closest to the average of the other's age in the team, to maintain communication between the players and to avoid communication gaps. Since we know that the number of players per team will be Odd, we just have to find the middle element(age). 

### Thoughts: I found the problem to be pretty straightforward, I knew I had to use an array/vector to input the elements. We needn't sort them since the input is ordered in either ascending or descending. After taking the input, I ust had to find the middle element for the Captain's age. 10/10

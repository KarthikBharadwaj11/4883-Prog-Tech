## 11614 - Etruscan Warriors Never Play Chess
## Karthik Bharadwaj Surya

## Description: In this program, we are given the number of soldiers and we need to find the number of rows in which they can be arranged. The idea given is that row 'i' contains i warriors. If there are any remaining spots in the last row and there aren't any warriors left to fill the row, it's okay, we can leave the rest of the row blank.

### Thoughts: I found this problem a little difficult to begin with. Although I could draw it out on paper and analyse it, I initially couldn't code it straight away. I tried a couple of logic that didn't work out and I finally had to work my way through this logic, with a little help from Google. I felt stupid because it was an easy breezy and it was easy, but I understood where I went wrong and learnt the approach. 

### Notes: I submitted this code to UVA and got it accepted. I tested it with udebug inputs and got the required output. Input file 2 is the udebug input and the output file is the corresponding output.

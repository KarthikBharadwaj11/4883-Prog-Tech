## Notes on the codes: 
### I have got most of my codes uploaded on UVA but due to an issue with their website, I couldn't upload a couple of other problems on UVA. I have pushed all my codes onto GitHub and have written README files for all my programs along with some thoughts I had while solving them. I have also attached input and output files for all my codes, along with the main.cpp. 

### Overall experience: This course helped me gain confidence in coding and took out the fear I had. I am much more confident now and prepared. I had a lot of fun solving the problems, although some of them were nerve-wracking. Solving the problem was one challenge but getting the SAME output that UVA accepts was another challenge. There have been many instances where I have had to debug simple programs to match the formatting of the outputs. Overall, the course was very insightful and confidence-boosting. I am eager to implement all the concepts learnt in real-world problems! 

### Thank you sir :)

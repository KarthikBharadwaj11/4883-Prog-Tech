## 11777 - Automate the grades 
## Karthik Bharadwaj Surya

## Description: In this program, we need to display the grades of STudents given their Term1, Term2, Final, Attendance and Class test marks. The final output should be their final grade considering the weightage of each part. 

### Thoughts: At first glance, it looked like a very easy problem. While coding it, I made simple logical mistakes because I was a little over-confident. However, I could finish coding this problem soon and it was fun to solve. PS: Input 2 has a lot of data, I had to create an output file to copy the data onto udebug.

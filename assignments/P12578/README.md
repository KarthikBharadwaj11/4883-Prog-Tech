## Description: In this program, we need to find the area of the circle and the rectangle around it in the Bangladesh flag. We're given the radius of the circle, and the length and breadth of the flag.

### Thoughts: It was an easy one, the data needed was given and the formula was simple. 10/10

## Notes: I tested the code with udebug input files and my output matched their accepted outputs. input file 2 is of udebug and the output file is the corresponding output. I also got this program accepted at UVA.

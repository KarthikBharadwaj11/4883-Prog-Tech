## Description: In this Program, we find the minimum speed the clown has to run to escape from the scary creatures. The speed of the clown needn't have to be very high, but just enough to run from the creatures. 

### Thoughts: This problem was fun. Coincidently I solved this problem during Halloween and I remember telling myself it was a good problem to solve that evening. Knowing the difficulty of the problem, I took a small amount of time to solve it and was bored for the rest of the evening (of Halloween). 9.5/10 (had to google for the syntax of the formula.

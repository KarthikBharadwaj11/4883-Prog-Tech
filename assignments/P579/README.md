## 579 - Clockhands
## Karthik Bharadwaj Surya

## Description: In this program, we find the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand of a clock given the time. For example, if the input is 9:00, the angle will be 90 degrees. 

### Thoughts: The problem looked very simple on the first look of it, but when I started solving it I got stuck and didn't know how to proceed. I googled the approach and read that there was a formula that could be applied to this kind of problem. I realised it was a direct substitution and it made it easy for me. Although there wasn't much to do after this, I made sure I understood why that formula worked and how we could calculate the angles. Also, while surfing, I came across a few more similar problems (which varied in formula) and I got to explore such problems. It was a fun experience considering I hadn't solved such problems before and it opened up many ideas. 7/10

## Description: In this program, we need to calculate the donations received. 

### Thoughts: I felt that this was a very easy problem and didn't need much thinking. I just had to add the donations cumulatively and display the end result. 10/10

### Notes: I got this problem accepted in UVA and tested it with udebug input files. Input 2 is of udebug and the output file is its corresponding output.

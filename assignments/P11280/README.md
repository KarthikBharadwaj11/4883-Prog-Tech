## 11280 - Flying to Fredericton
## Karthik Bharadwaj Surya

## Description: In this program, we are to find the minimum cost to fly from the source city to the destination city with the specified number of stop-overs. For example: Let us say you have to fly from DFW to LAX. You can either fly directly or fly through PHX or SLC. You can also take 2 stops and then go to LAX etc. I solved this problem using Dynamic programming and the Floyd Warshal Algorithm(partially). Dynamic programming helps in executing this code more effectively.

### Thoughts: When I first read the problem statement, I felt a little overwhelmed. I didn't know if I could solve it. I read this problem thrice to make sure I understood it completely and then I started breaking down the requirements. I started solving it step by step, searching for algorithms that could be used. Since I knew it was a graph problem, I knew the choices that I had. My task was to choose the most effective algorithm for this problem. I learnt a lot while exploring the different algorithms and I understood what could be used when. I had to use Chat GPT/other sources for the main logic,k to calculate the least cost for different numbers of stopovers. Although I understood the algorithm, I found it a bit hard to implement the code for it. Overall, it was a good learning for me to code this and solve it. It was very interesting. 7/10

### Note: I couldnt upload this code on UVA due to their server issue, but I checked the output with udebug inputs and got the necessary output.

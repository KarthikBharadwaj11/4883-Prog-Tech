## Description: This program deals with a soccer coach who makes the players practice a drill using a specific method. Our goal is to find out the player N who gives back the ball to the coach after P passes. 

### Thoughts: At first I was a little confused as to how to approach the code and what formula to use. I tried looking for similar math problems/ concepts that could help. I later came across the formula (K+P-1)%N+1 which I've used in my code. I would rate it 6/10 (the formula is hard to understand/ come up with at first glance).

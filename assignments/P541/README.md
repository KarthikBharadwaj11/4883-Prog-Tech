## Description: In this program, we are checking whether the given matrix has the parity property. A matrix is set to have parity property when every row and column in the matrix contains an even number of set bits (1). We have an option of changing ONLY 1 bit if it does not satisfy the property. If not, it is declared corrupt. 

### Thoughts: In my first read, I felt that this problem was interesting. My first thought was that I had to iterate through the matrix, row x column and had to check for the check bits. I also had to add the total value of the bits in every row and column and check if it was divisible by 2 (thereby checking if there is an even number of set bits). I had to use Chat GPT a little to get the logic right, but I knew what I was asking for and how to go about the code. 8/10

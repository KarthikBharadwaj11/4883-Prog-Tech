## 10226 - Hardwood Species
## Karthik Bharadwaj Surya

## Description: In this program, we are calculating the percentages of the species of trees in a particular area observed by a satellite

### Thoughts: This was a tricky problem for me. On an outlook, it seemed simple but while trying to solve it I faced some issues trying to logic it out. I didn't know how to set precision for the  output and I had to google that.I faced a lot of issues trying to correct the "presentation error". I always used to get an extra line and also, the last test case was always getting eliminated. I debugged it and finally could get my code accepted. 7/10

### Note: I got this code accepted on UVA online judge. I also tested my code with udebug inputs/outputs. My input 2 file is of udebug and the output file.
